# Elastic Cloud
### Elastic Resource Management in Cloud Computing

>The purpose of the project is familiarization with cloud computing environments that offer IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) services.
The main incentive here is the use of the elasticity that the cloud provides through dynamic computing resources management.

>For this purpose, an elastic web service will be created with the use of virtual machines from a public cloud computing service [Okeanos Cloud](https://okeanos.grnet.gr/).
A cluster/web farm of web servers will be installed and configured that will distribute content to users connected to them.

>The traffic that will result from the visits of users will change over time. As a result, the computing needs of the cluster will change.
Therefore a mechanism (load balancer) needs to be implemented, which depending on the observed workload it will dynamically change the reserved cloud resources.
